    <h1>About Shaya</h1>
    <h2>By Maya Coleman</h2>
    <p>Shaya is a 21 year old woman from Brooklyn New York. Shaya attends NYU and is
    persuing a degree in nursing! After college, she is thinking of moving to
  the west coast, because she has never left New York before. Hopefully a
change in scenery will be good for her. When Shaya is not in nursing school,
she enjoys painting, poetry slams and going out with her friends!</p>
